in order to send data up you have to create a prop which references 
a function in the parent component.

this prop is then called in the function that stores the data on the child page with the funciton name passed
as an argument

for example

app.js

<Toe PropName --- toeSize={calculateToeSize--Function Name}/>

toesize.js

function bla bla {
    dbjvlajdbv
    sdhvksj data
    )
    props.toeSize(bla bla);
}

transferring state by componenents using similar to above to 'lift state up'

cannot pass if they are not parent/child

need to find closest connection, pass state to parent then down to child component



create filter component -done

filter by year - dropdown menu - onchange - when selected new state the year should be forwarded to expenses

stored as a state in expenses
